Welcome to our living workspace! Actually, this is the automatically generated website based on the content living in our actual [workspace](https://github.com/sara-sabr/ITStrategy)!

As per the notice that can be found throughout our site, the content you will find all around should all be considered work in progress: there are no guarantees that the ideas, the propositions and even the presentations that we are developing here in the open will make it into production one day.

On the other end, we would gladly welcome your ideas and comments in order to continuously improve our work and, in a way, how ESDC offers its services to Canadians!

As part of our work, we will also be writing blog posts on various topics in order to share our findings upon researching literature, reading books or simply discovering things that may be of interest for the government overall.

Please feel free to jump in the [Issues](https://github.com/sara-sabr/ITStrategy/issues) and start exchanging with us!

~ The IT Strategy team
