For over 40 years now, [open source software](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20130419164101-1893586-open-source-is-eating-the-software-world/) has [slowly](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adrianbridgwater/2015/04/24/if-software-is-eating-the-world-then-open-source-will-chew-it-up-and-swallow/#142e68c13902) [taken](https://medium.com/@yusufhussain/software-is-eating-the-world-open-source-is-eating-software-how-do-we-fill-the-skills-gap-717e9e9c4f38) [over](https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/12/how-open-source-software-took-over-the-world/) the [world](https://developer.ibm.com/blogs/how-open-source-software-is-eating-the-world/) and is now present in every aspects of your life, even if you don't realize it.
It managed this feat not by forcing itself on people but by being [**open by default**](https://open.canada.ca/en/content/open-default-and-modern-easy-use-formats).

This post aims at explaining why this concept is important for you whether you are a software developer or not.

## What

Before diving too much into the `Why should I care?`, let's start with the `What does mean?`

Working in the open means that your workspace, or part of it, is public and participatory. [^1]
Note that by this definition, your workspace is not only discoverable and accessible to everyone who wishes to visit it but it is also setup to enable and encourage collaboration to your work.

That means sharing your drafts and work in progress, your planned activities and tasks, your notes and, yes, your source code.

It's not just "working out loud" and sharing the fact that you are doing "something".
It's promoting your work so that others may hear about it and communicating your intent of working with all parties interested whenever they feel like contributing.
It implies that people can come on their own and start proposing changes themselves to your work, not just when you share your screen during a weekly update meeting.

This is a very different approach than what most employees, both from the public and the private sector, are used to.
Normally, people will work on a document or their part of a project for a while. Then, the document will be reviewed by a select group, either because it is known by the employee's team or because it's the process.
Changes will then be done to the document based on the feedback and subsequent rounds of reviews will be done until a final approval is done.
Then, more changes will be done again.
Because a document or even software, is never perfect.

When you work in the open, feedback can be done live, as the document or the source code evolves.
You still control the changes made to your work.
Yet, you accept that you don't know everything and that others may know more than you on a topic.
And that's absolutely OK because that's the reality.
It requires humility and a desire to be inclusive and accessible.

A study on distributed educational professional networks [^2] highlights 5 key practices for the success of working in the open:

- Public storytelling and context setting
- Enabling community contribution
- Rapid prototyping “in the wild”
- Public reflection and documentation
- Creating remixable work products

This is a critical set of conditions for the success of open source projects where thousands of people with sometimes little in common come to contribute together for the greater good of all.
