For over 40 years now, [open source software](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20130419164101-1893586-open-source-is-eating-the-software-world/) has [slowly](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adrianbridgwater/2015/04/24/if-software-is-eating-the-world-then-open-source-will-chew-it-up-and-swallow/#142e68c13902) [taken](https://medium.com/@yusufhussain/software-is-eating-the-world-open-source-is-eating-software-how-do-we-fill-the-skills-gap-717e9e9c4f38) [over](https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/12/how-open-source-software-took-over-the-world/) the [world](https://developer.ibm.com/blogs/how-open-source-software-is-eating-the-world/) and is now present in every aspects of your life, even if you don't realize it.
It managed this feat not by forcing itself on people but by being [**open by default**](https://open.canada.ca/en/content/open-default-and-modern-easy-use-formats).

This post aims at explaining why this concept is important for you whether you are a software developer or not.

## What

### Public

Before diving too much into the `Why should I care?`, let's start with the `What does it mean?`

Working in the open means that your workspace, or part of it, is public and participatory. [^1]
Note that by this definition, your workspace is not only discoverable and accessible to everyone who wishes to visit it but it is also setup to enable and encourage collaboration to your work.

### Participatory

That means sharing your drafts and work in progress, your planned activities and tasks, your notes and, yes, your source code.

It's not just "working out loud" and sharing the fact that you are doing "something".
It's promoting your work so that others may hear about it and communicating your intent of working with all parties interested whenever they feel like contributing.
It implies that people can come on their own and start proposing changes themselves to your work, not just when you share your screen during a weekly update meeting.

### Cultural

This is a very different approach than what most employees, both from the public and the private sector, are used to.
Normally, people will work on a document or their part of a project for a while. Then, the document will be reviewed by a select group, either because it is known by the employee's team or because it's the process.
Changes will then be done to the document based on the feedback and subsequent rounds of reviews will be done until a final approval is done.
Then, more changes will be done again.
Because a document or even software, is never perfect.

When you work in the open, feedback can be done live, as the document or the source code evolves.
You still control the changes made to your work.
Yet, you accept that you don't know everything and that others may know more than you on a topic.
And that's absolutely OK because that's the reality.
It requires humility and a desire to be inclusive and accessible.

A study on distributed educational professional networks [^2] highlights 5 key practices for the success of working in the open:

- Public storytelling and context setting
- Enabling community contribution
- Rapid prototyping “in the wild”
- Public reflection and documentation
- Creating remixable work products

This is a critical set of conditions for the success of open source projects where thousands of people with sometimes little in common come to contribute together for the greater good of all.

## Why

This is all great but why should you, a public servant, even care about working in the open?

### It makes your work discoverable

We are more than 250,000 employees in the Government of Canada.
Some departments have more than 25,000 employees.
Shared drives, Intranet and various collaboration platforms are very often closed by default.

Files can be sensitive and they should be protected if that's the case.
But the workspaces themselves should be open by default so that we can collectively be able to share our work with our colleagues.

Yet, if anyone has tried collaborating with other departments or even with the private sector, you know it's a real nightmare and usually ends up being done via versioned documents on emails.

That is inefficient, error prone and sometimes simply impossible.

### Avoid duplication of work

The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat has launched the Enterprise Architecture Review Board a few years ago with the hope of catching wind of risky and/or duplicate projects to ensure that we collectively invest more wisely the departmental budgets in technologies.

Now, the process involves people preparing a concept case, submitting it for review, going through the gating concept, etc.

This is good to catch large initiatives but it creates another series of steps for departments and teams to deliver value to citizens in the hope of avoiding duplication of work.

Working in the open by default, releasing our work as open source and promoting its reuse across the government could help increase the adoption of solutions already in use and being developed across departments.
Without the overhead and rigidity required by a central body.

In reality, it could even open up opportunities of natural collaboration with other interested parties such as provincial and municipal governments and even the private sector.

### Economies of scale

This tweet from Vivian Nobrega sums it all very well:
