## Background
_Current mandate of ESDC_: The mission of Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), including the Labour Program and Service Canada, is to build a stronger and more inclusive Canada, to support Canadians in helping them live productive and rewarding lives and to improve Canadians’ quality of life  

_Current role of ESDC_: ESDC offers a range of programs and services such as seniors with basic income security, supports unemployed workers, helps students finance their post-secondary education and assists parents who are raising young children.   

_Preparing for the future_: Technology is redesigning human lives like never before - from how we reach to work to how University courses are delivered today. Due to the pervasiveness of global social and corporate influence, we may see a significant change in our preferences and habits. Our perceptions of well being and quality of life may be pegged on different attributes such as mental health, social inclusion, job security and continuous professional growth.   

Global technology trends are fast changing the economic and political situations around the world – redistributing wealth, the nature of work and opportunities. Global markets are seeing a shift from mainstream economics of scarcity towards economics of abundance. Digital goods and services are commonplace as commodities and information is universally accessible through high speed networks -making global market more cohesive.    

The emergence of new job roles, occupations and industries, and corporations with global workforce may lead to new challenges and social issues such as wage polarization, global skill competition, labour mobility, and unpredictable workforce demand. Planning ahead will prepare Canadians stay ahead of the technological curve and exploit their full potential.  
In pursuit of improving quality of life for Canadians, ESDC needs to manage these changes in society and provide a support structure to prepare Canadians towards unprecedented risks and disruption from global participants. 

## Vision 
Emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, blockchain and high speed network provides tremendous opportunities to renew the ESDC service delivery and augment the experience for Canadians. With greater planning and informed choices, ESDC’s technology-enabled service transformation can further the impact of its social safety net and make a more inclusive society.   

Canada has a unique and well-developed social welfare system. However, with the changing economic and social climate, this may quickly become outdated - impacting our economic growth and employment rate. Social inclusion and quality of life in future may be determined by disposition of different services and resources.    

Keeping in mind the digital vision of Canada's service delivery, business plan should be geared towards more realistic and achievable forecasts.  

**_Experimental initiatives and redefining services_**  
With no proven path yet and countries around the globe are grappling to give sense to the advancement in technology, Canada needs to put its own efforts to make informed decisions, leverage the opportunities and minimize long-term risks. 

Canada’s service delivery architecture should support new service discovery, and be modular for easy implementation of technology and policies. New solutions should be designed for rapid growth and scalability.  

Orchestrating the use of Canada's underlying innovation ecosystem and resources may be critical in the success digital transformation. Understanding the different nature of innovation such as incremental or evolutionary from disruptive and revolutionary and acknowledging the different need in funding and resource disposition would be crucial.  

Giving lead to innovation projects tend to that can be available at faster pace to these projects … funding, innovation design center, transformational resources (barriers to be successful is sometimes knowing the right people – as VCs/investors this knowledge becomes available)
> Knowing your customers and market ?? in gov sense ??   
> similar to the model of strategic innovation fund or super clusters organized by ISED …

**_Regulatory sandbox and data to function together_**  
~~In this picture of digital transformation, there are two main actors - regulations and data.~~   
Regulations on the use of emerging technologies and data are still in the formative stage. Long-term impacts and outcomes of these regulations are yet to be understood. In such as a case, regulatory sandboxes may be a safe avenue to try and moderate the impact of regulations.  
Giving meaning to data by bringing it together for public interest has remained a challenge. Existing policies on the use and storage of personal data has created pockets of fragmented information with different departments. Interoperability of data and related policies should be re-evaluated under the lens of public interest and societal benefit. Timely availability and accessibility of data plays a key role in making it truly functional and useful. 
> Example of Taiwan and Finland regulatory sandbox, India National AI Marketplace   

**_PPP model/Open source policy model/Open government_**
To fully exploit the potential of technologies, government needs to adopt new cooperation models to interact with private sector and citizens. The distribution of power and resources may have to be revisited and adjusted to generate greater responsiveness in public services.   
Utilize the global knowledge and resources …  
Open source model brings in greater compatibility with other technologies … which would mean greater compatibility in the future to collaborate with other countries … like internet is a shared resource?
> Examples of Australia’s project Capita, New Zealand’s Social Investment Analytical Layer Code, Australia’s data sharing agreement with LinkedIn

**_Social cohesion_**  
Digitization of services is growing exponentially in every sector and general population is embracing it in their lives. Yet we need to be mindful of the different population groups to understand any digital divide due to digital literacy, income, age, and other factors. 

Social cohesion and digital inclusion should be part of the policy framework to make all communities ready for the use of technologies. Enough placeholders may be placed …   

Also, since citizen engagement is seen as an imperative to keep pace with the technological advancement, pedagogical initiatives may be launched to support and train the citizens with the right skill-set.

> Centres of applied sciences, or libraries assist in digital literacy/inclusion       

**_Adaptability and Resilience_**
While we are thinking to disrupt the existing IT infrastructure and architecture, we should be mindful of technology-oriented strategies adopted by other nations.  

Innovation can be revolutionary and disruptive, however, with that it brings in greater risk. ESDC’s IT strategy such that it enables and acknowledges the risk associated with innovation. Funding and resources should be   

Resilience – capacity to maintain flexibility in case of future unknowns, … learn to fail … 
 
> European nations have regional strategies. Canadian government should think about the support structure it needs to create for Canadians to participate and harvest maximum benefits from global opportunities in workforce.


## Mandate
Our mandate is to architect and support implementation of a secure foundation of transformational technology to fulfil ESDC’s envision of human-centric service delivery in renewed social fabric, (and forge a trust relationship among Canadians) and create a cohesive environment for participation of citizens and corporations towards mutual societal (welfare) development goals   
~~Our mandate is to envision the role of ESDC in the fast changing landscape of social behaviour and needs, and drive human-centric service delivery through transformational technology and innovation~~

## Activities
**_Policy and strategy development_**
* Initiate new exploratory programs/projects and secure required funding/resources (_Who makes the submissions? Does each branch make their own submission? Does all submission go through CIO for approval first? Does IITB play a central role in project submissions? Within IITB is it Denis’s group that would do that?_)
* Recommend policies and program guidelines for digital products/services (_Who approves or make decisions on policies?_)
* Recommend suitable governance guidelines for exploratory programs/projects
* Create 3-year plan for research and development strategy for DevOps (_How would DevOps be governed? Are they independent?_)
* Ensure that ESDC’s technology programs/initiatives aligns with the themes of the strategic framework and priorities of the department
* Develop adoption strategy for modern/futuristic technology, including architecture design (enterprise, technical and solutions)  
**_Program(s) Management_**
* Continuously monitor technology trends to keep pace with technological development
* Perform risk identification and risk management (modern and secure technology)
* Network architecture design  
**_Resource Allocation_**
* Allocate resources between various projects/initiatives 
* Improve the sharing of information and resources between programs and across departments (How would bimodal work?)  
**_Organization Engagement_**
* Coordinate with other departments to centralize use and allocation of IT resources 
* Create/lead a working group (_invites members from across organizations_) for gathering information on prevailing IT challenges
* Stimulate dialogues on the use of technology to improve services  

## Orchestrating the ecosystem 

## Redesigning governance style
To keep pace with the digital habits of the citizens, ESDC needs to adopt technology at a much faster pace for service delivery. The IM and IT policies laid out by Treasury Board focuses on efficiency, stability and accuracy. Existing IM/IT governance style work well with projects associated with proven methodologies and technologies.   
However, it inherits some barriers for implementing exploratory projects. Exploratory projects are associated with innovating or experimenting to deliver a sudden transformation of business outcome. Redefining governance policies may be needed to promote:
* Adoption of lean culture and continuous/agile delivery practices for churning out new products and services 
* Initiate exploratory programs without sacrificing risk aversion governing nature 
* Tight alignment of programs with the branch priorities 
* Improves time-to-market and product evolution (Principle: "Fail fast")
* Make innovation a sustainable process

## Innovation process from prototype to routine service
How to redefine the services? Innovation from concept to scale? 
~~Examples of new/emergent services:
* Skills accreditation:  To compete with the global workforce, giving standard accreditation to Canadian skills may ease the workforce recognition at a global stage. It also helps in creating a Canadian brand in different industries
~~* Social and corporate influence: It is nearly impossible to foresee social and corporate influence on Canadians lives in the coming future. Emergence of digital value chain, commoditization of many skills/services and pervasiveness of data-centric applications are influencing human choices and needs. Sharing of data among government, businesses and individuals may seem natural and need of the hour. Government role in such a place may give rise to new services to individuals and businesses. 
* Future anticipation: With perceived wide scale adoption of AI and other technologies, there would a general displacement in the nature of work. This may require the citizens to retrain or learn new skills. ESDC can play a huge role in allaying the fears of citizens by anticipating their training and well-being needs through data-centric applications.
~~* portability of benefits, worker classification, and wage variability.~~
