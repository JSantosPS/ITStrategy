## Background
_Current mandate of ESDC_: The mission of Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), including the Labour Program and Service Canada, is to build a stronger and more inclusive Canada, to support Canadians in helping them live productive and rewarding lives and to improve Canadians’ quality of life  

_Current role of ESDC_: ESDC offers a range of programs and services such as seniors with basic income security, supports unemployed workers, helps students finance their post-secondary education and assists parents who are raising young children.   

_Preparing for the future_: 
The recent OECD’s publication on first intergovernmental standard on Artificial Intelligence (AI) is just a step towards the world’s readiness for adopting AI for innovation and improving human life. 

In private sector, technology giants are taking a lead by making huge investments in AI R&D, while startups and SMEs are not far behind in directing their research efforts towards adopting advanced technologies. Experts opine that technology is redesigning human lives faster than anticipated. Along with the pervasiveness of social media influence and a few incumbents holding majority technology services, we may see a far-reaching shift in our preferences and habits. Our perceptions of well-being and quality of life may be pegged on different attributes such as mental health, social inclusion, skill transitioning and continuing education.

Global technology trends are fast changing the economic and political situations around the world – redistributing wealth, the nature of work and opportunities. Global markets are seeing a shift from mainstream economics of scarcity towards economics of abundance. Digital goods and services are commonplace as commodities and information is universally accessible through high speed networks - making international markets more cohesive.

The emergence of new job roles, occupations and industries, and growing competition with global workforce may lead to new challenges and social issues such as wage polarization, global skill competition, labour mobility, and unpredictable workforce demand. Planning ahead will prepare Canadians stay ahead of the technological curve and exploit their full potential.

In pursuit of improving quality of life for Canadians, ESDC future policies and programs should manage these changes in society and provide a support structure to prepare Canadians towards unprecedented risks and disruption from global participants.

ESDC’s architecture plays a crucial role in delivering these new-age programs and steering through the digital era. IITB’s role is critical in shaping and managing the digital ecosystem to enable a robust and continued experience to Canadians, all while maintaining a trustworthy relationship with them.


## Vision 
Emerging technologies such as AI, blockchain and ubiquitous high-speed network provides tremendous opportunities to renew the ESDC service delivery and augment the experience for Canadians. With greater planning and informed choices, ESDC’s technology-enabled service transformation can further the impact of its social safety net and make a more inclusive society.

Canada has a unique and well-developed social welfare system. However, with the changing economic and social climate, this may quickly become outdated - impacting our economic growth and employment rate. Social inclusion and quality of life in future may be determined by the disposition of different services and resources such as upskilling, access to data and data-centric applications. 

Guided by the digital vision for Canada’s service delivery, business plan should be geared towards more realistic and achievable metrics. 

Plausible guidelines for ESDC’s new technology architecture and strategy:  

**_Readiness for innovation and cooperation_**  
With no proven path yet and countries around the globe grappling to give sense to the advancement in technology, Canada needs to put its own efforts to make informed decisions, leverage the opportunities and minimize long-term risks. ESDC IT governance model and technology architecture should be such that it enables incorporation of new services using advance technologies or improves efficacy of existing services – making innovation a sustainable process. Canada’s service delivery architecture should support new service discovery, and be modular for easy implementation of technology and policies.

ESDC’s research efforts should be directed towards experimenting and innovating using advance technologies for service delivery. The application of these technologies should be mindful of human rights and democratic values. New solutions should be designed for rapid growth and scalability.  

Orchestrating the roles of different players in the innovation ecosystem and disposition of resources may be critical in the success digital transformation. Innovation and adoption of newer technologies may push IITB through a paradigm shift in the business models rather than just repurposing the older models. 

> 1. Understanding the different nature of innovation (such as incremental or evolutionary from disruptive and revolutionary) and acknowledging the different financial and resource disposition would be key in planning and implementing such initiatives.

> 2. Leading innovation projects on a faster track to scale up by acting as a synchronizer - the gated process, technology innovation design center, transformational resources 

**_Regulatory sandbox and data to function together_**  
Regulations on the use of advanced technologies and data are still in the formative stage. Long-term impacts and outcomes of these regulations are yet to be understood. In such a case, regulatory sandboxes may be a safe avenue to try and moderate the impact of regulations.

Giving meaning to data by bringing it together for public interest remains a challenge. Existing policies on the use and storage of personal data has created pockets of fragmented information with different departments. Interoperability of data and related policies should be re-evaluated under the lens of public interest and societal benefit. Timely availability and accessibility of data plays a key role in making it truly functional and useful. 

> OECD “Enhanced access to data to leverage AI broadly, through open data policies, data interoperability and data format standardization as well as better management of personal data.”

> Example of Taiwan and Finland regulatory sandbox, India National AI Marketplace

**_New cooperation models and data sharing agreements_**
To fully exploit the potential of technologies, government needs to adopt new cooperation models to interact with private sector and citizens. The distribution of power and resources may have to be revisited and adjusted to generate greater responsiveness in public services from private sector.

New data sharing agreements for the benefit of societal development should be thought through to capitalize on the data accumulated by the private sector and vise-versa.

> Australia’s project Capita, New Zealand’s Social Investment Analytical Layer Code, Australia’s data sharing agreement with LinkedIn

> Inter-government data sharing - a new look?

> Inter-government resource sharing – North American or countries in the same pool developing services on the same platform

**_Social cohesion_**  
Digitization of services is growing exponentially in every sector and general population is embracing it in their lives. Yet we need to be mindful of the different population groups to understand any digital divide due to digital literacy, income, age, and other factors. Social cohesion and digital inclusion should be part of the policy framework to make all communities ready for the use of technologies. Enough placeholders should be placed to engage citizens to transition to the digital era.

Also, since citizen engagement is seen as an imperative to keep pace with the technological advancement, pedagogical initiatives may be launched to support and train the citizens with the right skill-set. 

> Centers of applied sciences, or libraries assist in digital literacy/inclusion

**_Adaptability and Resilience_**
Innovation can be revolutionary and disruptive, however, with that it brings in greater risk. 

Resilience is defined as “the capacity to maintain flexibility in case of future unknowns”. 

IITB should be prepared to learn to fail. Disposition of its funding and resources should be such that a failed innovation project has little impact on the existence and broader service delivery of ESDC.

> European nations have regional strategies.
