# Gabriel's Team Mandate Proposal

## Context

ESDC's IT Strategy team has been formed to enable the continuous modernization of strategic planning and enterprise practices in support of departmental priorities.

Maintaining the status quo limits ESDC IITB’s ability to enable the cultural change required to improve strategic planning for the branch and the department.

## Mission

In collaboration with stakeholders, our mission is to lay the path for the evolution and transformation of ESDC's IT services and processes.

## Objectives

* Identify, create, pilot and maintain a wide variety of strategies in support of ESDC’s and IITB’s service delivery mandate;
* Contribute to the medium term departmental program planning cycle; and
* Maintain relationships with the network of IT-related stakeholders.
 
## Deliverables

Whitepapers, presentations, case studies, blog posts, tweets, etc.

## Stakeholders

Internal teams, other government jurisdictions, other countries, academia, private sector and citizen

## Principles

* Learning is a priority (not having an answer to everything is normal);
* Team flexibility is important (e.g. telework, direction/mandate, tools);
* Design with users;
* Iterate and improve frequently (Be agile and nimble);
* Work in the open by default;
* Collaborate widely;
* Reuse (always look outside first to not reinvent the wheel);
* Think outside the box;
* Fail early, fail often (mistakes are ok);
* Always keep a fresh independent view (like it's your first day - don't get influenced by "we've always done this thing like this"); and
* When possible, pilot strategies with an internal team keen to try it.

## Bonus - 11 Tips for Pitching Innovation in government
(Reference: [Blog Post from GC Entrepreneur](https://medium.com/gc-entrepreneur/11-tips-for-pitching-innovation-in-government-9fceac5a3c9))

**1. Seed Doubt: Show the risks of the current approach**

Sometimes pointing out that the status quo is changing (in policy, in the marketplace, in technology, etc.) will help your audience come to the conclusion that a new approach is needed.

**2. Show it’s an ingrained problem where business-as-usual tactics aren’t working.**

Remind your audience that the problem you are working to solve is both long-standing and one where conventional policy and program efforts haven’t made sufficient progress.

**3. Explain what tacit knowledge or hidden expertise you are seeking to tap into.**

When and where you can, be explicit about how your idea or way of approaching the problem is targeting new information or insights that your organization isn't capturing through traditional means.

**4. Show the diversity of users to show the need for a diversity of solutions.**

Demonstrate the variety of stakeholders impacted by the issue, and their varied needs and challenges, to convey that a one-size-fits-all approach won’t work for your problem.

**5. Diversify the stakeholder base: Show how you are bringing in individuals, organizations, or sectors that don’t normally view themselves as part of the debate.**

Outline how your method has the potential to engage new stakeholders, or engage your traditional stakeholders in a new ways.

**6. Give them a Process.**

People often feel assured when they see there is a process being followed. So where possible, show your audience you have a structure in place for how you are progressing (e.g., phases, milestones, etc.).

**7. Citizens have new expectations that governments engage and be accessible. Show new tools and approaches are needed to deliver.**

Demonstrate the appetite for big change – examples include citing policy, technology, or demographic trends; creating future-oriented scenarios; or sharing the uptake of similar new tools from other jurisdictions.

**8. Show them they won't be alone.**

Give your audience comfort that you aren’t proposing they "go it alone": show them there’s experts ready to help, or an ecosystem of organizations working on solutions that could be tapped for collaborations.

**9. Build in your audience's track record of innovation.**

Reminding your audience of their organization’s history of experimentation and trying new things, might help make your case for more smart risk taking.

**10. Demonstrate learning: Instill confidence by capturing and sharing insights.**

Show your audience progress by demonstrating that your work in a new area or with a new approach is  resulting in knowledge or insight your organization didn’t have before.

**11. Show, not tell: Create opportunities for people to experience, then experiement, then engage.**

To help your audience become invested in your project idea – consider giving them a chance to experience the problem first hand, and then to experiment with possible solutions.

**12. Expect the unexpected.**

Your target audience may not react to your pitch when or the way you hoped they would.  But have faith! We've all seen good ideas come back around, and in surprising ways...
