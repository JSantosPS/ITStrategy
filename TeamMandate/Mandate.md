# IT Strategy

## Vision (image of the future)

The [Canadian Experience](../Strategies/HumanDevelopmentLifeCycle.md) is when Canadians are benefiting seamlessly of the federal government services through modern technologies.

## Mission (team's reason for existence)

Be the catalysts of change within IITB to lay the path for the evolution of ESDC's digital services.

This will be done through an open collaborative approach that will further ESDC's mandate in the digital era by aligning IITB with the Government of Canada's Digital Standards and Treasury Board's Policy on Service and Digital.

## Mandate (team's authority within IITB)

- Define the vision of IT within ESDC
- Briefing senior management on key organisational problems and recommended steps to address them
- Present recommended course of action to any ESDC governance body
- Challenge current thinking and approaches

## Team's Guiding Principles

### Add Value

All efforts must deliver measurable impacts.
Implement strategies -- do not be a document factory

### Work collaboratively

Collaborate with anyone and everyone who can _add value_.
This includes, but is not limited to, all Canadians, all levels of government, all departments, all private sector organizations, and all governments.

### Continuous learning

Learning must be a core part of daily activities to ensure up to date, modern, and well researched direction and strategy is provided to guide our actions.

### Lead by Example

By using the approaches and technologies we champion, we will be able to better respond to, and anticipate, the challenges that will be faced.
We will also be experimenting with modern ways of working in order to demonstrate their value and effectiveness.
This includes, for example:

- No PowerPoint decks.
  The document is the presentation.
- No document will be more than 5 pages.
- Nothing will be printed -- everything electronic
- No meetings longer than 1h & 30 minutes
- Conduct (bi-)daily meetings
- Conduct monthly retrospectives and planning meetings
- Keep track of all costs of meetings
