# IITB Key Performance Indicators (PKIs)

## Purpose

IT Strategies are meant to move IITB (and ESDC) towards the end state [Vision of the Canadian Experience](../TeamMandate/Mandate.md). The following KPIs will be used to measure those IT Strategies successes. Monitoring those KPIs will be used to adjust strategies as needed to ensure efforts are well invested and remain aligned with [IITB's high level priorities](http://esdc.prv/en/iitb/corporate/Who_We_Are/Plans_and_Priorities/index.shtml) that are to:

- Focus on the Core Business (of ESDC)
- Modernize IM/IT Service Delivery
- Be efficient in managing its operations
- Be connected with IM/IT partners and suppliers

## KPIs

1. **Percentage of ESDC Services consumable by APIs**

ESDC services provided to the public or to other departments will need to be delivered digitally. This means via APIs. This transformation to digital will be measured by the rate at which analogue services are changed to digital ones. The measurement will use [ESDC's Service Catalogue](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/corporate/portfolio/service-canada/programs.html) as reference point and monitor their transformation to digital.

2. **Reduction in processing time of ESDC Services**

The processing time of ESDC services that are provided to the public or to other departments will be an indication of improvement. The measurement will be the reduction in time, not the time itself, focusing on improvement rather than a hard target. The measurement will look at [ESDC's Service Catalogue](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/corporate/portfolio/service-canada/programs.html) and monitor their processing time.

3. **Percentage of IITB services made availble as self-serving SaaS**

IITB services currently offered, as catalogued in the ITSM Repository, will be offered as self-serving SaaS for IITB consumers. This transformation to self-serving SaaS will be measured by the rate at which those services are changed to self-served ones. The measurement will look at [IITB's Service Catalogue](http://iservice.prv/eng/service_catalogues/imit_services.shtml), which is being modernized for 2020, as reference point and monitor their transformation to SaaS.

4. **Reliability uptime of ESDC core systems**

Moving IITB into a service-oriented organization will require IITB to manage the complexity and growth of its services pro-actively. Reliability uptime, measured in the ***service's*** maximum allowable downtime, will be used to assess IITB's service reliability. The Core systems will be the ones flagged as *critical* within [ESDC's Application Portfolio Management (APM) program](http://dialogue/grp/PR6303013/APM_Program/default.aspx).

*Note:* Services are never expected to be up 100% of the time. [See here](http://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/wiki/OCIO_Application_Portfolio_Management/Application_Portfolio_Management_User_Guide#Application_Mission_Criticality_and_Critical_Services) for more details.  

5. **Increase rate of project intake by IITB**

IITB's project intake capacity will be measured by how much it improves, fostering a continuous improvement measurement over a hard target. The measurement will be on the rate at which intake capacity increases. The PMO's [Active Project List](http://dialogue/grp/ippst/Approved Projects Lists %28APL%29/Forms/AllItems.aspx?RootFolder=%2Fgrp%2Fippst%2FApproved%20Projects%20Lists%20%28APL%29%2FFY%202019%2D2020&FolderCTID=0x012000D8E2E348AB0A034886495AE4BED12E07&View=%7b2C779E42-EB28-444B-AACD-39CC61DDBCE2%7d), for Major/Minor/Small ESDC projects, as well as the PMO's [IITB Lite projects](http://dialogue/grp/ITPM-GPTI/Lists/IITBPMP%20Small%20Projects/AllItems.aspx) will be used as reference points to monitor intake increase.

6. **Reduction in Cyber-incidents**

This indicator will monitor the number of cyber-incidents across ESDC and measure the rate at which they decrease. 

7. **Client Satisfaction**

This indicator will use a yearly client survey to capture client satisfaction. Clients are lines of businesses across ESDC. This indicator will be qualitative in nature as client opinions are subjectives, and will be used to assessed the perceptions of IITB across ESDC. Note that this survey is different than IITB's APM Program. While the APM program assesses specific application performance, this Client Satisfaction survey is to assess IITB's overall perception.
