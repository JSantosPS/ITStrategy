# Create an Enterprise Information Modeling

The creation of a stable, and highly re-usable set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that expose relevant data and functionality is dependent upon the creation and continuous evolution of an Enterprise Information Model at ESDC.
Such model will also enable ESDC to move towards a ["tell us once"](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-operations-strategic-plan-2018-2022.html) goal.

The Enterprise Information Model is *not* a database schema, a particular system's logical data model, or a client profile.
It's a reference, with business terms, that development teams will use to quickly identify:

- Data entities being created and managed at ESDC
- The inter-relationships between those entities
- Their source of truth (system of record, data owner(s), data stewards, and API endpoints)

Any privacy concerns will be treated separately, outside of the Enterprise Information Model.

This aligns with key Government of Canada initiatives such as the Data Strategy, the [Digital Exchange Platform](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjMo6T5gavjAhXkUN8KHchmBCkQFjAAegQIARAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fciostrategycouncil.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F02%2FCanadas-Digital-Backbone-EN-Teresa.pdf&usg=AOvVaw0zdHuX2nso41PyGuBT-n6q), and the [API Store](https://api.canada.ca/en/homepage).

The Enterprise Information Model is part of a broader undertaking by either IITB's Information Architecture directorate, or the SSPB's Chief Data Office (CDO).
