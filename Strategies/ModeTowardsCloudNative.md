# Move towards a Cloud Native organization

ESDC will aggressively seek opportunities to adopt cloud computing and reap the benefits of rapid elasticity, increased agility, and self-serving abilities.

Moving ESDC to a Cloud Native organization will require the following:

1. Any new software development must be developed as a cloud native software *AND* deployed to the public cloud.
This includes up to Protected B data classification.
2. If deployed on premise, software must be built to natively support Cloud even if they are not ready to do so (e.g. having an ability to be portable to other providers using containers).
3. Each Development teams (dev, ops, testing) must have a public cloud sandbox made available to them, self managed and with predictable funding caps, with no connectivity to existing ESDC infrastructure intended solely for learning, innovation, and experimentation.
4. Ability to reach the cloud environment over the Internet, outside of the GCNet; enabling development to happen without government resources and freeing network bandwidth.
5. Start using the cloud before all the governance pieces have been established.
Using the cloud will provide empirical evidence that are necessary to define cloud governance.

It should be noted that SaaS procurement does not require involvement with SSC.
As of Budget 2017, ministers have the authority to grant federal departments and agencies the right to work directly with vendors even in areas that overlap with SSCâ€™s mandate.
Departments can use their delegated procurement authority to determine the right course of action in procuring SaaS (e.g. sole sourcing, advanced contract award notice, RFP).
