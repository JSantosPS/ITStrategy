# Implement DevOps

IITB will establish and mature a continuous deployment capability through DevOps so that it can be more responsive and adaptable to changing business needs.

Implementing DevOps means the following:

- **Foster and emphasize collaboration between team members**.
IITB must be deliberate to foster and emphasize the collaboration and communication of both software developers and IT professionals (testers, security analysts, architects, and testers) while automating the process of software delivery and infrastructure changes.
- **Adopt Test-Driven Development (TDD)**.
TDD is the practice of writing tests *before* development begins, and running the software code through those tests as development progresses.
- **Automate everything**.
This means build automation, test automation, continuous integration, release automation, infrastructure changes, security compliance, architecture compliance &#042;

&#042; Architecture compliance automation needs to be further evaluated.
