### Creation of Umbrella Fund 

#### Vision

Allow the creation of new agile procedures for approval, software, and hardware onboarding which self manages all resource sand funding with the intent of trialing new ways of working for the benefit of the organization.

*Option 3*

Leverage existing ESDC available funds

Submit a TB Sub for funds 

##### Development

ESDC's R&D team (and other opt-in ESDC development teams) will turn the business request into PoCs on fully open cloud instances, funded by the Umbrella Fund 

##### Approval 

The business through the Innovation Hub will approve and sponsor the project.
