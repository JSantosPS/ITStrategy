# Transition to Working in the Open by Default

IITB will lead by example by truly working in the open, fostering a collaborative approach not only within IITB and ESDC but across government jurisdictions.
Working in the open means enabling access to your work for others to see, making it easier to share your work and seek contributions, and exposing your efforts for the benefits of others.

The benefit for IITB will be to:

1. harvest the communities' input and efforts.
   Whether they be feedbacks, more direct connection with clients, or actual bug fixes
2. break down the silos between communities of excellence and practices
3. enable horizontal lines of communications instead of the traditional, rigid, hierarchical approach
4. dramatic collaboration improvements
5. greater empathy of users needs (whether they be colleagues, clients, or citizens)

Working in the open means:

1. Actively and aggressively releasing datasets to the open.canada.ca portal as per the [Directive on Open Government](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=28108)
2. Release software source code under an open source licence
3. Publishing software source code on an internet accessible repository (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)
4. Contributing back to 3rd party open source projects
5. Moving away from Sharepoint for storing information and collaborating
6. Maintaining a strong cyber-security awareness, knowing what not to put in the open and knowing what to do when sensitive information has been inadvertently released
