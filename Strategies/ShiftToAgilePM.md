# Shift to Agile Project Management

IITB will adopt a product management mindset wherein each Solution is viewed as a product and managed throughout its entire lifespan.

Solutions will no longer be delivered as projects that culminate with a release, but rather as products that are continuously improved through smaller, more frequent releases.

This requires introducing greater continuity between the initial release, growth, maturation, maintenance, and eventual retirement phases of a solutionâ€™s lifecycle.

Shifting to Agile Project Management will require the following:

1. **The use of dedicated product managers**
   Responsible for orchestrating the various activities associated with ensuring that a product delivered meets users' needs.
   Product managers also evaluates trends and strategic direction to determine features to build.
2. **Agile financial model**
   All projects must be built in an iterative fashion. Every product must be deliverable at the end of each quarter, where a functioning application that solves a business need is delivered, enabling attention to be focused as needed. 
3. **A dedicated team**
    One cross-functional team is assigned responsibility for the product from inception to the expiration of the business need for said product. 
    Teams are created with all expertise required to deliver the product. This includes, though is not limited to, business expertise, security expertise, development expertise, operations expertise, and testing expertise.
4. **There is no maintenance, only development**
   There is no differentiation between maintenance and development. In both cases, resources are assigned to an application to increase business value and deliver on a business need.
