# An Approach to strategy making
The following is a proposed approach on producing the IT Strategy. It takes as premise that strategy making is exploratory in nature at first, but can be made using a structured method to get clarity in the end.

## The approach

### 1. Establish the Vision

If we can bring ourselves 10 years in the future, how will ESDC Services be provided to citizens?

### 2. Identify target Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
What KPIs is required by IITB to provide services needed to support the vision?

E.g.:
* Number of services ESDC provides that are hosted on the GC API Store
* Number of services ESDC provides that are consumed by the public/industry
* Number of projects IITB can take on per year
* Number of services IITB provides that are digital in nature
* Number of API Product Owners
* Turnaround time of system changes
* Reliability uptime of core systems
* other?


### 3. Evaluate Operating Model (OM)
An organization is a complex system for delivering value. An [operating model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_model) breaks this system into components, showing how it works. It can help different participants understand the whole. It can help leaders identify problems that are causing under performance.

For the IT Strategy, the operating model will be IITB's.

We will need to evaluate the operating model in terms of Target State.

**Operating Model vs Capability Model** (what is the difference? and what is the relationship with Enterprise Architecture?)

E.g.:
* Project Governance
* Software Development LifeCycle
* Standards governance
* Assessment-based 

### 4. Indentify initiatives to change OM

With the Opertating Model evaluated at the Target State, this fourth step will identify individual initiatives that IITB must commit to in order to change the current opertaing model to the target one.

E.g.:
* Implement Bi-Modal Governance
* Move from Project Management to Product Management
* Adopt DevOps
* Monitor-based
