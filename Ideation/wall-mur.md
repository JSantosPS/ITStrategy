# Wall of things to improve

## Internal 

* Onboarding process at ESDC
  * Each form has it's own URL, platform etc.
  * May take multiple days to have access to service or tool (indicates a potential for automation)
  * Training is not tailored to individual user's needs or profile: may already have done the same training, why redo?
    * Journey mappging and stats would be useful: where does the employe come from? Internal GC or external?
* Adding IT services and tools to client desktops
  * Need reboot to install all applications

## External

* Saving "web app" as a PDF (i.e.: "interactive" PDF with links to pages within the PDF instead of an actual web app.)
  * [Canada Pension Plan disability benefit toolkit](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/pension-plan-disability-benefits/reports/toolkit.html)
  * Usability is minimal, hard to walk through, slow and laggy. Need to test for accessibility.
* Duplication of services through web and mobile apps: abstraction of the service, reuse of front-end and application of ruleset per job type.
  * ESDC [Jobs Search Mobile app](https://www.guichetemplois.gc.ca/applicationmobile)
  * [Talent Cloud](https://talent.canada.ca/en)
  * [PSC Government Jobs](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/jobs/opportunities/government.html)
