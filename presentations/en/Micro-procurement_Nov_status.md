ESDC IT Strategy team

to DG

---

## Agenda

- Micro-Procurement Pilot refresher
- Progress since last meeting
- How we think it will work
- Delivery plan
- Challenges
- Next Steps

---

## Refresher

- This will be a pilot/experiment
- Three goals:
  - reduce burden on procurement officers,
  - faster procurement/payment, and
  - removal of barriers to small and medium suppliers
- All procurements will be $10K or less
- All procured code will be licensed as open source
- Not just for teams already using open source

---

## Progress since June

- Secured agreement with CFOB to co-sponsor the pilot
- Resourcing requirements documented (FTE and $)
- Lite project process underway
- Decision to re-use existing systems wherever possible

---

## How it will work (we think)

- Static website (hosted by GitHub)
- Existing systems used in back-end : SAP, email
- All opportunities reviewed by IT Strategy team prior to posting
- All delivered code saved to an open repository
- Payment by credit card/PayPal

---

## Delivery plan

- IT Strategy to run the pilot for one year
- CFOB to provide oversight and monitoring
- ~10 micro-procurement contracts
- Q4 and Q1 promotions
- Q1/Q2 launch

---

## Challenges

- Backlog with EA team
- Potential challenge getting legal review of T&Cs

---

## Next Steps

- Lite project documents are with EA for review
- Continue working with CFOB to refine draft processes
- Seek ESDC clients
