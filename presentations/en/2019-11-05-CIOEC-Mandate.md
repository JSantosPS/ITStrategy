# IT Strategy team's mandate

## Purpose of CIOEC presentation

For discussion

---

## Context

- The new Policy on Service and Digital requires government services to be delivered using technology
- Demands for technology will increase exponentially
- Business agility depends on technology agility
- The use of technology is costly and risky
- ESDC can no longer see technological problems as "just an IT problem"

<!-- markdownlint-disable -->
*The use of technology to deliver a mandate ***must*** be a shared accountability*
<!-- markdownlint-enable -->

Note:
ESDC corporate risk profile identifies IT as the #1 risk to the organization
"The very point of digital transformation is to reduce risk" - War & Peace & IT.

## Team's guiding principles
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

--

Work collaboratively
Note:
Collaborate with anyone and everyone who can add value. This includes, but is not limited to, all Canadians, levels of government, departments, private sector organizations, and governments.

--

Continuous learning
Note:
Learning is a core part of daily activities to ensure up to date, modern, and well-researched direction.

--

Lead by Example
Note:
By using the approaches and technologies we champion, we are able to better respond and anticipate potential challenges. We also experiment with modern ways of working in order to demonstrate their value and effectiveness.

## Proposed IITB Mandated Priorities

--

Work in the open to avoid re-work

- Use a GIT-based version control system for all software
- Expose work in progress to other teams

Note:
ALL teams (developers, security, testing, operations) must use git.
ALL Sharepoint sites must allow any ESDC employees read access by default
Expose work in progress to improve team communication
Leverate [Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=25049) as foundational trusts with employees
Encourages collaboration and fosters a culture of flexibility, mobility and well-being

--

Core competencies (continous learning)

- All IT teams must use 10% of their time to learn
- All IT teams must use 10% of their time to automate manual processes

Note:
IT teams must use 10% of their time to learn/try new technologies, attend events/conferences and stay up to date on trends and technologies related to their work
IT teams must use 10% of their time for automation of testing, deployments and other manual processes
Empower multidisciplinary teams and allow them to work on new ideas in pursuit of business goals that solve important problems

--

Modern tools

- Architecture must actively and fairly consider open standards and open source software
- Architecture must enable deploy-anytime capabilities, with high degrees of automation
- Access to common Internet (SaaS) must be open by default to IITB personnel

Note:
Public servants are more effective at delivering services, programs and policies when they have modern tools that help their work and a modern workplace.

Public servants need professional development that keeps up with changing times and changing technology

--

Avoid Toil

- Automate as much processes as possible
- All teams must have at least two members with knowledge of programming to assist with process automation

Note:
Toil is the kind of work tied to running a production service that tends to be manual, repetitive, automatable, tactical, devoid of enduring value, and that scales linearly as a service grows.

Invest in automation: 1 month/year (e.g. august) dedicate entirely to automation and process improvement

--

Re-visit Investment Management practices

- Promote smaller investments over large ones
- Monitor investments based on business outcomes, not project plans
- Move and support product management
- Use Agile methodologies, iterate and continually improve solutions and services

Note:
Monitor investments on business outcomes, not project plans
