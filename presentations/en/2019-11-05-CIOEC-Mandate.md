# IT Strategy team's mandate

## Purpose of CIOEC presentation

For discussion

---

## Context

- The new Policy on Service and Digital requires government services to be delivered using technology
- Demands for technology will increase exponentially
- Business agility will depend on technology agility
- The use of technology is costly and risky
- ESDC can no longer see technological problems as "just an IT problem"

*The use of technology to deliver a mandate ***must*** be a shared accountability*

## Team's guiding principles
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

--

Work collaboratively
Note:
Collaborate with anyone and everyone who can add value. This includes, but is not limited to, all Canadians, levels of government, departments, private sector organizations, and governments.

--

Continuous learning
Note:
Learning is a core part of daily activities to ensure up to date, modern, and well-researched direction.

--

Lead by Example
Note:
By using the approaches and technologies we champion, we are able to better respond and anticipate potential challenges. We also experiment with modern ways of working in order to demonstrate their value and effectiveness.

## Proposed IITB Mandated Priorities

--

Work in the open to avoid re-work
Note:
ALL teams (developers, security, testing, operations) must use git.
ALL Sharepoint sites must allow any ESDC employees read access by default
Expose work in progress
Leverate [Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=25049) as foundational trusts with employees

--

Core competencies (continous learning)
Note:
20% of staff's time must be allocated to learn

--

Modern tools
Note:
Public servants are more effective at delivering services, programs and policies when they have modern tools that help their work and a modern workplace.

Public servants need professional development that keeps up with changing times and changing technology

--

Integration over creation
Note:
Do not compete with the private sector. Teams must prioritize integrating ESDC services into the existing IT ecosystem over developing, or improving existing, client facing applications competing for Canadians' attention. Create jobs, not software.

Any new IT change must favour APIs over UIs

--

Avoid Toil
Note:
Toil is the kind of work tied to running a production service that tends to be manual, repetitive, automatable, tactical, devoid of enduring value, and that scales linearly as a service grows.

Invest in automation: 1 month/year (e.g. august) dedicate entirely to automation and process improvement

--

Re-visit Investment Management practices
Note:
Monitor investments on business outcomes, not project plans
