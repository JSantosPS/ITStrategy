# Working in the Open

---

## What

--

Your workspace (or part of it) is public and participatory.

Note:

- Public and Participatory - [Mozilla - Working Open](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Working_open)

--

People can find your workspace and read its content

Note:

- Drafts
- Planning
- Tasks
- Notes
- Source code

--

Enable and encourage contributions

Note:

- Inner Source - Entire organization, not just your branch or your team
  - Lots of redundancy
  - Opportunities to find and reuse solutions
- Open Source
  - Thousands of people working together
  - Various levels of contributions
- Do not force collaboration (see [HBR Collaborative Overload](https://hbr.org/2016/01/collaborative-overload))
  - It has to come organically (people interested, similar issues, etc.)
  - Can be sporadic (simple fixes, no commitments)

--

It's not "working out loud"

Note:

- Not just sharing one way
  - Meeting every week to showcase your progress
- That's different but also important
- Promoting, Sharing, Communicating what you are working on
- Helps people discover your open workspace and projects

--

It's a also cultural thing

Note:

- Humility
  - "I don't know everything"
  - "You may have a better answer than me"
- Inclusiveness and accessibility
  - No discrimination
  - Encourage participation of everyone
- Trust
  - You trust your team
  - You trust this is good for the public
  - The public should be able to trust the government
- Willingness to learn and improve

---

## Why

--

### It makes your work discoverable

Note:

- It's hard to look for something you don't know exists
- It creates opportunities to create a community

--

### Economies of scale

Note:

- I don't know everything
- MANY problems are already solved
- Many solutions can be useful to problems/people you haven't thought of

>It's all about software engineering economics

Stephen Walli, Principal Program Manager at Microsoft

Note:

- Writing good code is hard
- If you work in the open and build a community, your team is bigger than the amount of people you can hire

--

### Early feedback loop

From DevOps Handbook

Note:

- Shift left, don't wait months to fix something that can be fixed now
- Peer review is very valuable

--

### Trust

The public has the right to know, the public may want to know

---

## When

--

As soon as possible. Now.

Note:

- Don't wait until you had all your committees reviews
- Don't wait until it's perfect (it never is)
- Start your drafts in the open (improve the way you write)
- It's a lot harder to open up at the end
