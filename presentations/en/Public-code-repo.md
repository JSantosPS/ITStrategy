- Working in the open with Canadians
  - Official use: Micro-procurement pilot
- Client (ESDC) can setup a repo; where
- Supplier can
  - pull code from existing branch
  - push changes to a branch

## Micro-procurement pilot

What is it?

Work (code) produced as part of the contract is saved in a specified branch on a public source code repo.

**Using appropriate open source software licences**

## Questions

Is use of Github.com acceptable for external collaboration in ESDC?

As part of Micro-procurement pilot?

In general (working in the open)?
