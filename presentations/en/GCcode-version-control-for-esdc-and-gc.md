## Version Control for ESDC and GC

## The Ask

Provide support in evolving [GCcode](https://gccode.ssc-spc.gc.ca) platform (Version Control and Project Management) to become officially supported within the GC

**Goal:** Enable maximum sharing and reuse

---

## ESDC Context

[ESDC Open Source Software Management Framework](http://dialogue/grp/TAWS-ATST/Collaboration+Architecture+Services/Projects/Artificial+Intelligence+and+Open+Source/OSS/ESDC+Open+Source+Management+Framework+v+1.2.docx)

Endorsed at ARC – September 2019

- Use Open Source Software (OSS)
- Contribute to OSS communities
- Publish code as OSS

---

## GC Context

### [Directive on Management of IT](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15249)

#### Mandatory Procedures for EA Assessment

- All source code must be released under an appropriate open source software license
- Share code publicly when appropriate, and when not, share within the GC

### [GC Digital Standards](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/government-canada-digital-standards.html)

#### Work in the open by default

- Make all non-sensitive data, information, and new code developed in delivery of services open to the outside world for sharing and reuse under an open licence

---

## Current State

Each department manages its own internal Version Control/Project Management platforms

> ESDC has a mix of TFS, SVN and GitLab (Azure)

For open source code and working in the open, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) hosting is recommended

> ESDC is using mostly Github.com

---

## GCcode

SSC maintains an unofficial "best effort" shared instance called GCcode (internal to GC), based on GitLab OSS:

- ≈3600 projects and ≈3000 users
- 350+ users from ESDC
- 50 GC organizations
- 17k+ issues and 8k merge requests

(As of May 2019)

https://gccode.ssc-spc.gc.ca

## Proposal

To increase sharing/reuse in the GC

- Evolve GCcode as an officially supported internal Version Control and Project Management platform for the GC community, with assistance from ESDC (e.g. funding)
- Make it the default working environment for all source code projects in ESDC (visibility: GC-wide or private)

Not just a copy of the code, it's where teams work.

A stepping stone to working in the open by default!

---

## More than just source code

- **Projects** (groups, repositories)
- **Issues** (bugs, features, tasks)
- **Kanban** (prioritize/visualize tasks)
- **Continuous Integration** (automated testing)
- **Wiki**
- **Websites** (GC theme available)
- **Integration** with other systems
- ...

See [GitLab Features](https://about.gitlab.com/features/)

## Why not Github.com (1/2)

### Advantages of public SaaS

#### 1. Provider's Infrastructure

_Popular SaaS providers usually have resources and ability to stay current and innovate._

#### 2. Work in complete Openness

_Allow employees to work in the open with the rest of the world._

#### 3. Private Repositories

_Private projects are available for free with limitations (3 collaborators) or as part of a subscription ($)._

---

### Drawbacks of public SaaS

#### 1. Comfort Level with Openness

_Teams can be reluctant to work completely in the open yet._

#### 2. Vendor Lock-in

_Providers' roadmap is determined based on industry funding, not on GC's interests._

#### 3. Expensive

_Licensing of private repositories at GC level could be expensive compared to scaling a private open source platform._

#### 4. Low power of influence over SaaS

_More difficult to influence the direction of a SaaS compared to an open source project open to contributions._

---

## SaaS vs GCcode

### SaaS

- Available on the Internet
- Unclassified information only
- No control over platform (risk of lock-in)

### GCcode

- Available on GC network
- Unclassified information only but could be certified Protected B
- Open source instance of [GitLab](ghttps://about.gitlab.com) OSS that we control

## Benefits to ESDC – IITB

- **Cost savings** through consolidation on a single platform
- Strengthen **relationship** between IT and business through a common Version Control and Project Management platform
- Improve the **quality and security** of code with automated testing
- **Accelerate** the rate of development and deployments
- **Discover/reuse** code from other projects (incl. other depts)
- Obtain metrics/statistics for **reporting** and continuous improvement

---

## Benefits to ESDC – Existing Projects

- Benefit from a **common** development platform:
  - Functionalities covering the full development lifecycle (code, issues, tasks, Kanban, automated tests and deployments)
  - Adoption and training
  - Centralized project communications
  - Making work visible
  - Increasing collaboration through reduction of silos
- Enhance **planning** of feature development through a single view
- **Automate** tracking of work
- Ensure **accountability** by logging changes and incidents
- Improve code **quality** and **collaboration** by developing in the open, thereby reducing overall risk

## Proposal

- Evolve GCcode as an officially supported internal Version Control and Project Management platform for the GC community, with assistance from ESDC (e.g. funding)
- Make it the default working environment for all source code projects in ESDC (visibility: GC-wide or private)

---

### Next Steps

- Commence discussions with business owner of GCcode (SSC CIO)
- Determine and plan evolution of the service
  - Business model, service levels, hosting environment, accessibility/security, additional features...
- As required, set funding agreement(s) with ESDC and other departments
- Implement technical changes & Formalize a support team within SSC
- Update ESDC OSS Guidance (e.g. When to choose GCcode vs GitHub, How to migrate projects from one to the other)
