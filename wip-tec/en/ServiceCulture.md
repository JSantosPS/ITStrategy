# Service Culture 

## Everyone is a Client 

It is commonplace to refer to your end users as clients, though we rarely refer to those we work with as clients -- though we should. In our Service Culture, everyone who uses the work you produce, especially those directly adjecent to you in the value stream, are your clients. 

### Systems Thinking 

This new paradigm would require each group to ensure that the work they do is designed to faciliate the work of those who interact with their services. It aligns well with the [Systems Thinking](https://itrevolution.com/the-three-ways-principles-underpinning-devops/) approach recommended in modern day literature elaborating on modern digital organizational structures.  

### Power of Choice 

It also supports the natural reallocation of resources and facilities the identification of unnecessary [Context Switches](https://itrevolution.com/context-switches-in-software-engineering/) that take place within the department, and reduce organizational efficacy. 

#### Example

If there exists a group that does not add to the [Value Stream](https://itrevolution.com/starting-devops-value-stream/), then all other groups need the option to opt out of using the services provided by this group. Conversely, if a group does add value, then groups will gravitate towards their services. A reduction of services indicates either that the services of a given group are no longer required due to technilogical innovations, process, or organizational changes, or that the work provided by the group does not add value for other members of the value stream.
