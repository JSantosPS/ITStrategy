### Problem Statement

In [Team Topologies](https://itrevolution.com/book/team-topologies/) they write that organizations should organize themselves by nesting the four team definitions.

- Value Stream Aligned Teams
- Platform Teams
- Enabling Teams
- Complex Subsystem Teams

In our particular case, to use it as an example, the IT Strategy team is an enabling team. We are under an director who himself considers his role to be an enabling team.  Therefore, the IT Strategy team is an enabling team, within an enabling team, and has other sibling teams that are also enabling teams. That being the case, how would one synchronize activities of the entire directorate? Say the director were to offer their services to a team elsewhere in the organization. How best to manage and coordinate the work between the series of sub-enabling teams? That is the question this document is intending to answer.
