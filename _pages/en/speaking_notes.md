# Speaking Notes for IT Strategy feedback

The following are speaking notes the IT Strategy and BRM teams can use when feedback is sought while working in the open.

## Purpose

To solicit informal feedback from the community while work is in progress.

The community is anyone from ESDC, other federal departments, and the industry.

## Collaborative approach in the open

Such feedback is not meant to be official positions from lines of businesses or buy-in.

Instead, it is an opportunity for fellow colleagues to add their perspective to the IT Strategy team.

Their perspective provides valuable feedback to a team who's [mandate](https://sara-sabr.github.io/ITStrategy/mandate.html) regards setting the IT direction of the organisation, diagnosing key organisational problems, and recommending course of actions to resolve them.

This differs from traditional peer review cycles of:

1. Produce draft
2. Seek comments from first committee
3. Dispose committee comments
4. Seek comments from second committee
5. Continue for **n** committees
6. Publish document

Such traditional approach is timely, hinders valuable feedback from knowledgeable minds that are often hidden in the organisation, and dilutes the integrity of the content.

Instead, the IT Strategy's team approach is to work in the open in order to give anyone, regardless of their position in the organisation, an opportunity to express their professional opinion and ideas.

This does not mean seeking consensus.

Rather, it allows the IT Strategy team to hear from a broad and diverse perspective.

Only then would a formal peer review process to seek executive buy-in is to occur.

## Types of feedbacks the IT Strategy team looking for

- Are there missing topics that need to be addressed?
- Are there topics that are misrepresented or do not reflect the lines of businesses perspectives?
- Are their reference sources that you can recommend the IT Strategy team to look at (e.g. articles, studies, official documents)
