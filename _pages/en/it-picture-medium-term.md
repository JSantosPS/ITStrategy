# IT Vision Picture - Medium Term

This is a working document to help create a picture of what will IITB look in the medium term for ESDC.

In the following sections, we're trying to take the same end state and create "views" where different audiences would be looking at ESDC and see different things.

## Citizen

- Mix of old and new..
- Current portals and accounts
- OneGC
- API Store
- Pan-Canadian Trust Framework
- Some benefits integrated with 3rd parties

## Businesses

- Able to find and integrate with 50% of ESDC services

## Non-profits

- Able to find and integrate with 50% of ESDC services

## IITB-ESDC

- IITB controls 20% of it's funding for Internal IT Projects 
- IITB is involved in business discussions and decisions (TODO: Are we now? What body should we be apart of, and who should be a part of it?)
- 75% of employees are equipped with mobile devices allowing them to work from anywhere (TODO: Map trend and profiles on to metric )
- Flexible work arrangements where employees may work remotely, insofar as it does not impact their ability to perform in their role 
- Employees are empowered to continuously learn through self directed learning. Management must allow at least 1 hour per day per employee to be spent learning new, or developing existing, skills 
- Employees are sharing their experiences and best practices (Tech Talks)
- Open by Default Development Policy 
  - Justification required as to why a project is not being developed in the open
- All newly architected solutions must communicate through APIs 
- Cloud First
  - Projects by default must use the cloud. Justification required if the project is not intending to use the cloud 
- (TODO: What does EAs role look like in 5 years? Sources and references [CDS or 18f, for example])
- All new projects must deliver a functional product at the end of each quarter, at the absolute latest.
- Development teams have access to modern development tools needed to keep pace with industry best practices.
