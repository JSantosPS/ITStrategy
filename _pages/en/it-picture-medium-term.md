## IT Vision Picture - Medium Term

This is a working document to help create a picture of what will IITB look in the medium term for ESDC.

In the following sections, we're trying to take the same end state and create "views" where different audiences would be looking at ESDC and see different things.

- [Citizens](#citizens)
  - [Automatic Enrollment and Delivery](#automatic-enrollment-and-delivery)
  - [Self-Service](#self-service)
  - [Service Centres and Outreach](#service-centres-and-outreach)
- [Private Sector](#private-sector)
  - [Any platform, any device, 3rd party integration](#any-platform-any-device-3rd-party-integration)
  - [Open Collaboration](#open-collaboration)
- [IITB-ESDC](#iitb-esdc)
  - [Modern Open Organization](#modern-open-organization)
  - [Strong Culture of Learning](#strong-culture-of-learning)

### Citizen

#### Automatic Enrollment and Delivery

It must be a priority to move towards the long term vision of a fully automated enrollment process for citizens who opt to use the service. As a stepping stone, it must be a priority to allow for a policy similar to ['Once-Only' from the European Union](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/eu-wide-digital-once-only-principle-citizens-and-businesses-policy-options-and-their-impacts) to be implemented. This means that IITB must ensure information can be securely and digitally exchanged throughout the information technology infrastructure. In order to enable such initiatives, which would enable IITB and citizens alike to avoid constant rework, IITB must be permitted and promoted to allocate significantly more resources to continuous process and technology improvements. We explore this requirement in more detail below in the [Modern Open Organization](#Modern Open Organization) section.

#### Self-Service

- Centralized login for all ESDC services
- Application processes should be simple and guided.
  - Pages with scrollable instructions outlining details of the application process are a relic of the past.

#### Service Centers and Outreach

- Humans should focus on interacting with other humans through outreach. Repetitive processes should be handled through computation.

- Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (TODO: How does this impact the citizen?)
- Some services (TODO: which?) are accessible using services I am already familiar with (Ex: My Bank)

### Private Sector

#### Any platform, any device, 3rd party integration

- Small businesses should start to innovate using ESDC data sets published through the Open API Store

#### Open Collaboration

- Small businesses should start to innovate using ESDC data sets published through the Open API Store

### IITB-ESDC

#### Modern Open Organization

- IITB strictly controls 20% of it's funding for Internal IT Projects
- IITB is involved in business discussions and decisions (TODO: Are we now? What body should we be apart of, and who should be a part of it?)
- 75% of employees are equipped with mobile devices allowing them to work from anywhere (TODO: Map trend and profiles on to metric )
- Flexible work arrangements where employees may work remotely, insofar as it does not impact their ability to perform in their role
- Employees are empowered to continuously learn through self directed learning. Management must allow at least 1 hour per day per employee to be spent learning new, or developing existing, skills
- Employees are sharing their experiences and best practices (Tech Talks)
- Open by Default Development Policy
  - Justification required as to why a project is not being developed in the open
- All newly architected solutions must communicate through APIs
- Public Cloud First
  - Projects by default must use the cloud. Justification required if the project is not intending to use the cloud
- (TODO: What does EAs role look like in 5 years? Sources and references [CDS or 18f, for example])

#### Modern Development Tools

- Development teams have access to modern development tools needed to keep pace with industry best practices.

#### Strong Culture of Learning

### ESDC Departmental Clients

#### IITB Responsiveness

IITB will be able to more quickly address multiple projects throughout the year by implementing a quarterly production release (at the very latest), for all projects. By adhering to an agile deployment methodology and a product management approach, the highest business value should be delivered early on in the project and made available to clients after each quarter. As the circumstances change, this problem may then either be worked on for another iteration (one quarter) or, if the relationship between time committed and business value gained would decline compared to other projects competing for resources, then another project made be onboarded for the proceeding quarter. For further details regarding the case for quarterly deployments, please refer to our [documentation](./quarterly-delivery.md).
