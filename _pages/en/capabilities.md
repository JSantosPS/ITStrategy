## Capabilities

The State of DevOps report has be published annually since 2014.
It's a well-respected survey to help to understand how DevOps culture and practices supports organizations to improve software engineering, release, quality, security, and generally receiving feedback on product development.
The report supports the visualization of the contribution of DevOps to the organization's overall business performance.

The authors of the report identified 24 key capabilities, in 5 categories, that drive improvements in software delivery performance in a statistically significant way.
The capabilities and data are detailed in [Accelerate: By Forsgren, Humble & Kim](https://itrevolution.com/book/accelerate/).

IITB and ESDC should continuously improve these capabilities.
