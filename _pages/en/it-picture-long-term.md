# IT Vision Picture - Long Term

This is a working document to help create a picture of what will IITB look in the medium term for ESDC.

In the following sections, we're trying to take the same end state and create "views" where different audiences would be looking at ESDC and see different things.

## Citizen

- Services are automated and self-service by default
- 95% use digital services mapped to Canadian profiles
- Benefits are automatically given based on major life events
- Service centres educate or use digital services on behalf of clients (for 5%)
- In-person service through kiosk to address 5% of clients who are not online or want a more personalized service
- Departments have common kiosks to offer services (integrate with IRCC PassPort service)
- Electronic kiosks (or robots) in public areas like shopping malls (win-win for government and businesses + generate economic growth)
- Service centres staff are deployed in outreach programs to raise awareness in low uptake areas
- GC (OneGC) portal provides access to all services (not just ESDC) in Ask Once fashion
- Benefits are integrated into third party platforms and services

### Government IoT Integration 

ESDC does not develop products or services that compete with the private sector.
IoT devices will begin to permeate all aspects of life and ESDC should integrate itself into the ecosystem. 

An example of the repercussions of such an implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/sara-sabr/ITStrategy/blob/master/wip-tec/en/human-development-life-cycle.md).

In a service-based environment, success is not measured by the number of users your service attracts, but rather the number of users amassed by the services that leverage your service. 
- TODO: Add source (Microsoft)

User privacy must still be preserved and modern digital identity recognition technologies are leveraged (e.g. facial, biometrics).

For more details on its implementation, please refer to the [Business section](##Businesses)

> “Automatic enrollment reduces the burden on many seniors by enabling them to receive their Old Age Security pension and Guaranteed Income Supplement at age 65 without ever having to apply for them. We continue our efforts to modernize the Old Age Security and Guaranteed Income Supplement services to meet the needs of Canadians.”
> > ––The Honourable Jean-Yves Duclos, Minister of Families, Children and Social Development

## Private Sector

- Able to find and integrate with all ESDC services
- Create ecosystem of services by leveraging private sector expertise where opportunities exist (win-win public-private partnerships)
  - E.g., banks detecting missed paycheck, job websites targeting people who are job hunting
  - Enhanced security through integration in private sector service (e.g., banks detecting fraudulent transactions)

## IITB-ESDC

TODO: Split in two (IITB and Partners/Clients)

- IITB is the digital, IM and IT advisor and enabler for ESDC
- IITB is part of major business decisions
- 90% of employees are able to work from anywhere (TODO: validate measure with trends)
- IITB is a modern open organization with a very open culture that values learning (TODO: find a tangible example)
- All internal and external services are available through APIs
- 98% of services are running on public cloud infrastructure (TODO: find cloud adoption rates)

## Government Partners

For:
- Digital Exchange (APIs, Messaging)
- Cloud Brokering
- HR Services
