## IT Vision Picture - Long Term

This is a working document to help create a picture of what will IITB look in the medium term for ESDC.

In the following sections, we're trying to take the same end state and create "views" where different audiences would be looking at ESDC and see different things.

- [Citizens](#citizens)
- [Private Sector](#private-sector)
- [IITB-ESDC](#iitb-esdc)
- [Government Partners](#government-partners)

### Citizens

- [Automatic Enrollment and Delivery](#automatic-enrollment-and-delivery)
- [Self-Service](#self-service)
- [Service Centers](#service-centers)
- [IoT Integration](#iot-integration)

#### Automatic Enrollment and Delivery

Enrollment and delivery of services is automated by default and wherever possible.
GC Services are integrated with widely used third party platforms and services (Banks, CRA, Social media, Job boards, Internet of things, ..).
90% of citizens (33 300 000 people) have a trusted Canadian profile used to verify/validate identity.
These citizens receive their benefits seamlessly throughout their lives as major life events trigger the delivery of benefits.

#### Self-Service

The GC (OneGC) Portal provides access to services and benefits (not just ESDC) in tell us once fashion.
Registering to the Portal will create or use the trusted Canadian profile and enable automatic enrollment and delivery in the future.
Help for using the Portal is available directly on the Portal using instant messaging (text, voice or video) as well as by phone.

#### Service Centers

For the 10% not enrolled automatically and unable to use the GC Portal (3 700 000 people), small service centres are available, especially in remote regions.
Their role is to help citizens register and use digital services.
They can also use the digital services on behalf of clients.

GC departments have common kiosks to offer services, such as passports, taxes, grants as well as benefits from ESDC.
Outreach programs are deployed to raise awareness in low uptake areas.

#### IoT Integration

ESDC does not develop products or services that compete with the private sector.
IoT devices will begin to permeate all aspects of life and ESDC should integrate itself into the ecosystem. 

An example of the repercussions of such an implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/sara-sabr/ITStrategy/blob/master/wip-tec/en/human-development-life-cycle.md).

In a service-based environment, success is not measured by the number of users your service attracts, but rather the number of users amassed by the services that leverage your service. 
- TODO: Add source (Microsoft)

User privacy must still be preserved and modern digital identity recognition technologies are leveraged (e.g. facial, biometrics).

For more details on its implementation, please refer to the [Business section](##Businesses)

> “Automatic enrollment reduces the burden on many seniors by enabling them to receive their Old Age Security pension and Guaranteed Income Supplement at age 65 without ever having to apply for them. We continue our efforts to modernize the Old Age Security and Guaranteed Income Supplement services to meet the needs of Canadians.”
> > ––The Honourable Jean-Yves Duclos, Minister of Families, Children and Social Development

### Private Sector

Any platform or device can be integrated with GC and ESDC services.
This is possible because ESDC services are available as APIs that can be used by third party platforms and services (Banks, CRA, Social media, Job boards, Internet of things, ..).

- Create ecosystem of services by leveraging private sector expertise where opportunities exist (win-win public-private partnerships)
  - E.g., banks detecting missed paycheck, job websites targeting people who are job hunting
  - Enhanced security through integration in private sector service (e.g., banks detecting fraudulent transactions)

### IITB-ESDC

#### Modern Open Organization

IITB is a modern open organization with a very open culture.
Wherever possible code and projects are developed in the open and use of open source software is the norm.

#### Strong culture of learning

TODO: Split in two (IITB and Partners/Clients)

- IITB is the digital, IM and IT advisor and enabler for ESDC
- IITB is part of major business decisions
- 90% of employees are able to work from anywhere (TODO: validate measure with trends)
- IITB is a modern open organization with a very open culture that values learning (TODO: find a tangible example)
- All internal and external services are available through APIs
- 98% of services are running on public cloud infrastructure (TODO: find cloud adoption rates)

### Government Partners

For:
- Digital Exchange (APIs, Messaging)
- Cloud Brokering
- HR Services

### Terms
