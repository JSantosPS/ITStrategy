# IT Vision Picture - Long Term

This is a working document to help create a picture of what will IITB look in the medium term for ESDC.

In the following sections, we're trying to take the same end state and create "views" where different audiences would be looking at ESDC and see different things.

- [Citizens](#citizens)
- [Private Sector](#private-sector)
- [IITB-ESDC](#iitb-esdc)
- [Government Partners](#government-partners)

## Citizens

- [Automatic Enrollment and Delivery](#automatic-enrollment-and-delivery)
- [Self-Service](#self-service)
- [Service Centers and Outreach](#service-centers-and-outreach)

### Automatic Enrollment and Delivery

Enrollment and delivery of services is automated by default and wherever possible.
GC Services are integrated with widely used third party platforms and services (Banks, CRA, Social media, Job boards, Internet of things, ..).
90% of citizens (33 300 000 people) have a trusted Canadian profile used to verify/validate identity.
These citizens receive their benefits seamlessly throughout their lives as major life events trigger the delivery of benefits.

### Self-Service

The GC (OneGC) Portal provides access to services and benefits (not just ESDC) in tell us once fashion.
Registering to the Portal will create or use the trusted Canadian profile and enable automatic enrollment and delivery in the future.
Help for using the Portal is available directly on the Portal using instant messaging (text, voice or video) as well as by phone.
This assistance will be delivered by AI or services center staff.

### Service Centers and Outreach

For the 10% not enrolled automatically and unable to use the GC Portal (3 700 000 people), small service centres are available, especially in remote regions.
Their role is to help citizens register and use digital services.
They can also use the digital services on behalf of clients.

GC departments have common kiosks to offer services, such as passports, taxes, grants as well as benefits from ESDC.
Outreach programs are deployed to raise awareness in low uptake areas.

## Private Sector

Any platform or device can be integrated with GC and ESDC services.
This is possible because ESDC services are available as APIs that can be used by third party platforms and services (Banks, CRA, Social media, Job boards, Internet of things, ..).

- Create ecosystem of services by leveraging private sector expertise where opportunities exist (win-win public-private partnerships)
  - E.g., banks detecting missed paycheck, job websites targeting people who are job hunting
  - Enhanced security through integration in private sector service (e.g., banks detecting fraudulent transactions)

## IITB-ESDC

### Modern Open Organization

IITB is a modern open organization with a very open culture.
Wherever possible code and projects are developed in the open and use of open source software is the norm.
IITB is the digital, IM and IT advisor and enabler for ESDC and part of major business decisions.

- 90% of employees are able to work from anywhere (TODO: validate measure with trends)
- All internal and external services are available through APIs
- 98% of services are running on public cloud infrastructure (TODO: find cloud adoption rates)

### Strong culture of learning

IITB is a modern open organization with a very open culture that values learning (TODO: find a tangible example)

- Digital Exchange (APIs, Messaging)
